# Ray Tracing and Simulation Experiments

Ray tracing is used to generate realistic wireless channel data for training and evaluation.

The experimental process includes:
- Running ray-tracing simulations using NVIDIA Sionna.
- Computing multipath propagation between different transmitter and receiver locations.
- Extracting channel responses from the simulated environment.
- Using the generated data to support receiver training and performance analysis.

This simulation-driven approach makes it possible to explore a wide range of propagation scenarios without relying entirely on physical measurements.
