# Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate the system using metrics that reflect how a real 5G receiver would perform in practice.

The main metrics include:
- **Latency**: How long it takes for data to travel from the base station to the receiver.
- **Throughput**: The data rate the system can support under different channel conditions.
- **Bit Error Rate (BER)**: The fraction of bits that are received incorrectly.
- **Block Error Rate (BLER)**: The fraction of data blocks received with errors.
- **Coverage Accuracy**: How closely the digital twin’s predicted coverage matches observed behavior.
- **Robustness**: How much performance degrades when interference or environmental changes are introduced.

These metrics are used to compare a traditional signal-processing-based receiver with an AI-native receiver trained on digital twin data.
