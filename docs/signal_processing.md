# Signal Processing Background

The project compares an AI-native receiver with a traditional 5G receiver based on standard signal processing techniques.

The traditional receiver follows a typical 5G NR pipeline, including:
- OFDM modulation and demodulation
- Time and frequency synchronization using reference signals
- Channel estimation and equalization
- QAM symbol detection and decoding

In contrast, the AI-native receiver learns to decode signals directly from data generated by the digital twin, rather than relying solely on hand-designed processing blocks.
