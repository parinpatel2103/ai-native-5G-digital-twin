# Digital Twin Modeling

A digital twin of the UT Austin campus is used to model realistic wireless propagation environments.

The modeling workflow includes:
- Importing 3D building geometry from OpenStreetMap.
- Cleaning and processing the geometry so it can be used in ray-tracing simulations.
- Representing key urban features such as building height, spacing, and surface structure.
- Using the resulting environment to simulate location-specific wireless channels.

This digital twin allows us to study how signals propagate in a complex, real-world setting while keeping experiments repeatable and controlled.
