# 🤖 AI-Native 5G Base Station Receiver Trained with a Digital Twin

🎓 Senior Design / Honors Project — UT Austin  
👨‍🏫 Advisor: Prof. Kaushik Chowdhury  

---

## 📌 Overview
This project studies how an **AI-native 5G receiver** compares to a **traditional signal-processing receiver** when evaluated using a **high-fidelity digital twin** of the UT Austin campus.

Instead of relying on simplified wireless channel models, we use **physics-based ray tracing** to better understand how receivers behave in realistic propagation environments.

## 🧠 System Overview
![System Overview](figures/systemblockdiagram.png)

The system is organized as a three-phase pipeline:
1. **Digital twin generation and channel simulation**
2. **AI model training using synthetic channel data**
3. **Deployment and evaluation in a 5G testbed**

This structure allows direct comparison between AI-native and classical receivers under identical channel conditions.

---

## 💡 Motivation (Why)
Wireless systems are often designed and tested under ideal assumptions that do not fully capture real-world effects such as:
- multipath propagation  
- blockage from buildings  
- interference from nearby transmitters  

This project explores whether **machine-learning-based receivers**, when trained on environment-specific channel data, can better adapt to these conditions than traditional signal-processing approaches.

## 🛠️ System Design (What)
The system is designed as an end-to-end evaluation framework that includes:
- 🏙️ A 3D digital twin of the UT Austin campus  
- 📡 Physics-based wireless channel simulation  
- 📊 A traditional 5G receiver baseline  
- 🤖 An AI-native receiver architecture  
- 🧪 Hardware-in-the-loop validation using a channel emulator

## 🏗️ Digital Twin Environment

Campus geometry is imported from OpenStreetMap and LiDAR-derived data to construct a realistic 3D environment.  
This digital twin is used to generate ray-traced channel profiles that capture building-induced blockage, reflections, and multipath effects.
